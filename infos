Dear Github family!

I have a big problem, I restarted my computer a few days ago, I saved the Wallet.dat file from my Bitcoin Core wallet, but not the password🙄

Now I've searched a lot here for what could help me, I found a few pages, but nothing that could help me quickly😵

Although I found and downloaded a tool, it is packaged in a zip file that can help me quickly. But the author hasn't gotten back to you for days😵‍💫

Since I need the Bitcoins very urgently, I'm hoping for help from the community🙏

❓ Is there a way, a script or a tool where I can get the password or private key very quickly?

❓ Can I extract the files from the zip archive without knowing the password or having to spend ages working with John and Hash-Cat?

I am open to all possibilities and am also willing to pay a good commission IF SUCCESSFUL❗

❗I expressly state here:
❌ I will not send the wallet.dat file to anyone!
❌ I will pass on the tool in the zip archive when I can open it, not before!

I need the Bitcoins very urgently because I trade and work with them, but now I can't access my assets.
